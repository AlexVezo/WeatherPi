# WeatherPi
A weather station with the Raspberry Pi

# About the project
In 2015, I started tinkering with the Raspberry Pi 1B. After my first approaches to draw and build wirings, I challenged myself to build a weather station as my first major project. The weather station measures temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, wind direction and precipitation. In 2017, I participated with v1 of the weather station at the competition _KiWi-Preis_ (see [more](https://helmutschmidtgymnasium.de/schulleben/veranstaltungen/kiwi-preis-fuer-digitale-wetterstation/)).
